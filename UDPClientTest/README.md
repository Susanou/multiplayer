# UDPClientTest

Project to try and create a multiplayer game with a dedicated server from scratch. The server is written in python and the clients in C# using Unity 2021.2.10f1.
The client sends the signal to the server and the server sends back the updated movement and rotation for all the clients that are connected.

## TODO

- [x] Movement of players
- [ ] Rotation of players (works locally)
- [ ] Camera movement for individual player
